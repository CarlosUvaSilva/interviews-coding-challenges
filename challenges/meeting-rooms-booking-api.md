# Context

Evil Corp is a growing company, and has a lovely office in Amsterdam.
As teams are expanding, we sometimes want to use the same meeting rooms for different teams.
In this phase of our transformation into a big evil corporate, we now need a meeting rooms booking application.

# Goal

You'll cover some basics about API design and TDD.
As such, you'll mainly focus on the backend of the application.
Others will build apps later, using your API as backbone.

The following user stories describe what should be possible to do through this API:

- A visitor can sign up (only with an "@evil-corp.nl" e-mail address though)
- A user can book a room
- A user can update his own booking
- A user can cancel his own booking
- A user can view all of his / her bookings
- A user can invite other users to the booking
- A user can add rooms
- A user can remove rooms

# Constraints

## Tooling

- You must use **RSpec** for TDD (focus on acceptance and integration tests)
- You can use **Postman** to test out your API
- You can use any convenient gems you may need
- Your code must be available on **GitHub / Gitlab**
- The API must be deployed on **Heroku**

## Timeline

Our employees are expecting to be able to use this app in 1 week. Move fast hombre!
